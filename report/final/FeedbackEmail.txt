Dear Archimedes, Alessandro, Oliver and Ion,

Many thanks for your report, I enjoyed reading it. Overall you performed a good analysis and completed the project with sensible results for which I give you a mark of 7/10. The main reason why you lost marks is because there was no figure showing the optimization of the distance itself and the associated discussion of the methodology and results was very short. This made it very difficult for me to judge the second part of the project. An outlook for potential improvements for the analysis would have also been appreciated. Having said that the results do look sensible so I assume everything has been done correctly.

I hope this feedback and the course is useful,

Best wishes,

Patrick
